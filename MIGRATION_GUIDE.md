# Wedding Website Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide covers migrating from the JSON file-based photo storage to a proper Supabase database with event organization.

## Database Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration
Since the Supabase CLI has issues, run the migration manually:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `yneuslauisvgqauyqnzd`
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250609_photos_and_auth.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### 2. Verify Migration
After running the migration, check that these tables were created:
- `users` - User management with groups
- `events` - Wedding events (Getting Ready, Ceremony, etc.)
- `photos` - Photo metadata with event organization

### 3. Test the New Features

#### Event Filtering
1. Visit `/friends/gallery`
2. You should see a dropdown filter for "Events"
3. The filter should be populated with default data:
   - **Events**: Getting Ready, Ceremony, Cocktail Hour, Reception, After Party

#### Photo Organization
- Photos can now be organized by specific wedding events
- Event filtering works to show photos from specific parts of your wedding day

## API Changes

### New Endpoints
- `/api/photos/supabase` - New Supabase-based photo API
- `/api/events` - Fetch wedding events

### Legacy Support
- `/api/photos` now redirects to `/api/photos/supabase`
- Graceful fallback if Supabase fails

## Copy Updates
âœ… **Fixed Generic Wedding Copy:**
- "Wedding Gallery" â†’ "Our Moments"
- "Beautiful memories" â†’ "From getting ready to dancing the night away"
- "Processing your beautiful memories" â†’ "Adding your photos"
- Loading and empty states updated

## Champion Authentication (Current System)

You're keeping the token system for your 4 photo champions:
```
âœ… ?token=aastha-family-champion
âœ… Simple and works for small group
âœ… Easy to share via URL
```

**Current champion tokens:**
- `aastha-family-champion`
- `preetesh-family-champion` 
- `friends-champion-1`
- `friends-champion-2`
